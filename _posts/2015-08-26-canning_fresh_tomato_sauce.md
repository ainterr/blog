There are countless advantages to home canning and I've been meaning to start for quite a while now. One of the main things I've been looking forward to is having fresh, farmer's market tomato sauce available in the dead of winter. I've been eyeing the tomatoes at our local farmer's market every week and they've just now reached their peak ripeness. After buying some quart-sized canning jars and a large stock pot for a water bath, I got to work canning some 8 lbs of fresh tomatoes.

The biggest challenge I had was getting all of the pots to fit on my stove... Once I'd figured that out, the rest was a breeze.

### **Picking the Best Tomatoes**

Tomatoes should only be canned in the peak of summer, when they're at their ripest (and cheapest) and you should always used the highest quality tomatoes you can get. Otherwise, it's hard to justify the time it takes to make and can the sauce. In my reading, I found that people generally prefer to use some variety of plum tomato (ie Roma) because the high surface area to volume ratio leads to a more flavorful sauce. My local farmer's market, unfortunately, doesn't sell them so I opted for regular, vine-ripened tomatoes, making sure to select the smallest and the reddest.

### **The Process**

I started a pot of boiling water and made an ice bath to blanch the tomatoes. While I was waiting for the water to boil, I washed and cored (cut out the hard part once connected to the vine) the tomatoes, cutting a small x into the bottom of each one.

I then boiled the tomatoes in batches for about 45 seconds each, submerging them in the ice bath immediately after.

After blanching, the skin peeled away easily. I just threw the skins away this time but, with a bigger batch, you could make tomato paste out of them. I then chopped them coarsely in a food processor - I like my tomato sauce somewhat chunky - and placed them in a pan to simmer for about an hour. The amount of time that you simmer them can vary between 30 minutes and an hour and a half depending on your desired taste. Less cooking time will give the sauce more of a fresh tomato taste while more will give you a thicker sauce and a deeper, cooked tomato taste.

While I simmered the sauce, I started heating the canning water. With my 21.5 quart pot, it took about an hour to come to a boil. Just before it reached a rolling boil, I sanitized the cans and each of the canning tools I planned on using by placing them in the water for about a minute each.

When the sauce reached a taste and thickness I was happy with, I added some vinegar (about a quarter cup) to increase the acidity to a safe level for canning and a few pinches of salt for taste. I then filled the jars, screwed on the lids, and processed for about 30 minutes in the boiling water.

When all was said and done, about three hours of work turned 8 lbs of tomatoes into two quarts of sauce, perfect for any recipe that calls for canned tomatoes. The recipe I used said these would keep for about a year. I'm definitely looking forward to having them this winter!

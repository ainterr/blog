As of yesterday, June 19th, my girlfriend and I have been dating for three years. We exchanged gifts and both planned elaborate surprizes for each other - I woke up at 4:30 in the morning to make her banana pancakes before work (that we ate while listening to [Banana Pancakes](https://youtu.be/SfnuApqiDBA)) and she set up a cute treasure hunt for me to come home to to find my card. I\'ve been stepping it up in the kitchen lately and, although I knew I had to make her favorite dessert, bananas foster, I wanted to try something completely new for dinner. As is my custom when I\'m looking for something new to cook, I browsed [Epicurious](http://www.epicurious.com/), looking for pretty pictures and impressive sounding titles until I stumbled upon a recipe for [Chile-Braised Short Ribs](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/chile-braised-short-ribs-51147480). Having never braised anything and never cooked short ribs, it seemed like an appropriately challenging recipe to celebrate 3 years together.

### **The Process**

I made a run to the grocery store a few nights ahead to make sure I could get all of the ingredients I needed. The Whole Foods near my apartment has a pretty good butcher and I found some very nice short ribs at a great price. The only thing I wasn\'t able to find was ancho or New Mexico chiles so I substituted pastilla chiles, or chiles negro. These chiles aren\'t as spicy as their dried poblano counterparts (anchos) but instead have a much more complex flavor and result in a thick, smokey marinade with a lot of deep flavors. Rather than buying the ground cumin and coriander that the recipe calls for, I ground it fresh from the spices my girlfriend brough back from her most recent trip to India.

The night before, I made the marinade and coated the short ribs, allowing them to sit in the fridge overnight. Gallon ziploc bags are essential for marinating anything since excess air can change or detract from the flavor and strength of the marinade.

Since I don\'t have a dutch oven, I used a crock pot to slow cook, rather than braise the ribs - two hours of braising converts to about eight hours in the crockpot on low. Cooking in a crockpot also traps in a lot more moisture than braising so I used about half the chicken broth that the recipe called for. After cooking the vegetables, reducing the sauce, and plating, the ribs were fantastic!

## **Chile "Braised" Short Ribs**
Adapted from [Epicurious](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/chile-braised-short-ribs-51147480)

### **Ingredients**
* **3.5 lbs.** Thick, cross cut, bone in short ribs (about 4)
* **6 to 8** Dried chiles of your choosing (ancho, pastilla, New Mexico, etc.)
* **1** Lemon
* **1** Onion
* **3 or 4** Carrots
* **8 to 12** New or finger potatoes
* **2 tbs** Small can tomato paste
* **2 cups** Chicken stock (beef stock can also be used)
* **2 tsp** Ground coriander
* **1 tsp** Ground cumin
* **3** Garlic cloves
* **1/2 cup** Olive Oil
* **5 tsp** Coarse Ground Kosher Salt
* Parsley for garnish

### **Directions**
1. Remove the stems and as many seeds as possible from the dried chiles. Toast in a pan over medium heat until they start to puff up and smoke. Transfer to a bowl and cover with warm to boiling water and let set until soft. Remove remaining seeds.
2. Combine garlic, tomato paste, coriander, cumin, salt, olive oil, zest and juice of lemon, and the softened, seeded chiles in a food processor and pulse until smooth. Add olive oill if necessary to form a thin paste for the marinade.
3. Toss ribs with mixture in a gallon ziploc bag until coated and allow to marinate in the fridge overnight.
4. Add ribs, chicken stock, and diced onion to a crockpot and cook on low for about eight hours.
5. Transfer ribs to a foil-lined baking sheet, cover with foil, and set in the oven on warm.
6. Slice carrots into two inch segments. Add carrots and potatoes to the crockpot and turn it up to high. Cook until vegetables are soft and have absorbed the flavor of the marinade - a couple hours.
7. Transfer carrots and potatoes to the oven with the ribs. Strain the liquid from the crockpot into a medium saucepan and reduce by 3/4 over medium-high heat, skimming fat from the top occasionally with a paper towel - about 15 minutes.
8. Plate the ribs and vegetables, drizzle sauce over the top, and add finely chopped parsley for garnish - one rib per person.

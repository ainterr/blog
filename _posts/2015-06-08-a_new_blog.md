I've wanted a place to put my ideas, archive the technical tutorials I write, and talk about my projects for a while now. [My website](http://ainterr.github.io) was a good start but it ended up being more of a visual resume than an actual venue for my ideas. That's where this blog comes in. It's built on Jekyll and I've open sourced it under the MIT license. Check out the source code [here](https://github.com/ainterr/blog).

That's all for now. Be sure to check back later when I write my first post series on custom Windows deployment using the [Automated Installation Kit (AIK)](http://www.microsoft.com/en-US/Download/details.aspx?id=5753).

One of the main reasons I enjoy cooking is that you can create delicious, healthy, high-quality meals at an incredibly low price. My girlfriend and I spend around $100 per week on groceries for the two of us, we pack our lunches, and we eat out maybe once a month. With the two of us eating three meals a day, that works out to a little more than $2 per meal. One of my main focuses has been on cooking as much "from scratch" as possible. I find that, the more basic the ingredients you start from, the better the taste and price. The trade off, of course, is time. I've always made fresh pasta from scratch, but recently I decided to try making cappelletti - a cousin of tortellini.

Cappelletti, literally "little hats" in Italian, are nearly identical to tortellini but are usually slightly larger and have a pointed, rather than rounded, top. While tortellini are typically made by stuffing small circles of pasta with ground meat, cappelletti are made with squares. Because I didn't have a round cookie cutter, I opted for the latter.

### **The Process**

I decided to go the traditional route and combined a spicy Italian sausage with prosciutto, parmesan, and bread crumbs for the filling. After running it all through the food processor I let it chill in the fridge while I made the pasta.

I then made four eggs worth of pasta using the recipe I've developed over the last year or so - a cup and a half of [my favourite flour](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/), table spoon of olive oil, and a pinch of salt per two eggs and warm water to combine.

Then, the real work began. One strip at a time, I cut 2" squares.

Then I filled them.

Then I sealed them with a touch of water and wrapped them around my finger to create the final shape.

When all was said and done the whole process took more than three hours for about six servings. I cooked two servings immediately, with a little less time than store-bought tortellini. No sauce needed here - to fully appreciate the flavor of the cappelletti I served it with just olive oil and a little salt and pepper. The rest I let set until sufficiently dried and then stored in a tupperware in the fridge.

## **Cappelletti from Scratch**

### **Ingredients**

#### **Filling**
* **4 oz** Spicy Italian Sausage (cured)
* **4 oz** Prosciutto
* **1/4 Cup** Shredded Parmesan Cheese
* **1/4 Cup** Breadcrumbs
* **1 egg**
* Nutmeg
* Black Pepper

#### **Pasta**
* **4** Eggs
* **3 Cups** Flour
* **2 Tbs** Olive Oil
* Room Temperature Water
* Fine Salt

### **Directions**

#### **Filling**
1. Combine sausage and prosciutto in a food processor and chop until fine chunks remain.
2. In a separate bowl beat the egg and add some fresh grated nutmeg.
3. In a bowl, combine meat with parmesan and breadcrumbs and fold in the beaten egg.
4. Cover the mixture and place in the fridge to chill.

#### **Pasta**
5. Add flour and a pinch of salt to a (clean) food processor.
6. Turn the food processor on low and room temperature eggs, one at a time. Eggs can be run under hot water for a short time to reach room temperature.
7. With the food processor running, add olive oil and continue adding warm water as the mixture thickens.
8. The exact amount of water to add varies based on altitude, humidity, and flour quality (I could write an entire blog post about this) but, when the mixture is slightly thicker than coarse sawdust transfer it to a lightly floured working surface (preferably wood).
9. Combine dough particles, folding, pressing, and rolling into a ball. Sprinkle flour on the outside of the dough ball and cover with a towel, letting it set for about 15 minutes.
10. After the dough has had time to fully distribute moisture, cut it into eight small balls. Flatten each with your hand before running through a pasta machine, one notch at a time until reaching a #3 thickness.
11. Hang the pasta somewhere it can dry for a short time - I use a clothes rack but have used the backs of chairs in the past.

#### **Final Steps**
12. Working one pasta sheet at a time, cut pasta into small 2" squares.
13. Fill with a small spoonful of filling and fold two of the corners together, sealing with a touch of water.
14. Wrap the remaining corners around your finger and set the finished cappelletti on a well floured surface.
15. Continue until all pasta and filling has been used, cover the hanging pasta with a damp towel if it begins to get dry.
16. Allow the cappelletti to set for a few hours before storing in a dry container in the fridge or cook immediately. Serves 6 - 8.
